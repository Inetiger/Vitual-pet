# Vitual pet

This was the first of many PartnerProgramming sessions, I was set with Ingrid and choose to work
on the virtual pet program.

## What does it do?

Well the program is of a virtual pet, which you can take care of,
the idea is most recognizes by the Tamagotchi.

We have 3 bars to follow (Pee, Hunger and Affiliation), it's random how much it falls and
how much it climbs, we also have a counter to see how long you've satisfied the pet.
